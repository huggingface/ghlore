"""The GitHub REST client.

Two shapes of pagination, because section 3 measured two different limits:

* :meth:`GitHubClient.paginate` follows the ``Link: rel="next"`` header **verbatim** and
  never constructs a ``page=`` parameter itself. That is what makes cursor pagination
  automatic: when GitHub hands back ``after=`` cursors instead of page numbers, following
  the header picks them up with no code change, and we cannot walk into the HTTP 422 that
  ``page=101`` returns on a large dataset.
* :meth:`GitHubClient.paginate_since_chained` is for the endpoints hard-capped at 30,000
  items, where ``since`` combined with ``direction=asc`` does **not** lift the cap. It
  takes a slice, reads the last item's timestamp, and uses it as the next ``since``.

Both shapes go through :meth:`GitHubClient.request`, which retries on two different
signals: a status GitHub returned (5xx, or a rate limit), and an exception no status came
back with (a dropped connection, a timeout). The second is not decoration — section 3
sizes a large repository at a restartable day, and over that many requests a transport
failure is routine; unretried it ends the process mid-walk.
