"""The poll loop -- section 5.2's delta detection, in two layers.

Layer A asks *which threads moved*; layer B re-reads each one and lets
:func:`~relore.ingest.index_thread.index_payload` do the set diff, because GitHub never
says *what* changed inside a thread.

Almost every line here is defence against one failure class: a pass that loses threads
permanently while looking successful. Three rules do the work, and each earns its
complexity.

1. **Ascending by timestamp, and the checkpoint advances per committed thread.** Not per
   pass, and never to ``now``. A process killed mid-pass resumes where it stopped.
2. **The checkpoint stops at the first failure.** Threads arrive ascending, so advancing
   past a failed one would skip it forever -- and the pass would still report success.
   Later threads are still indexed (that is idempotent and useful); only the mark waits.
3. **A capped walk bounds how far the mark may move.** The two list queries are ordered
   differently, so the uncapped one can surface a thread far newer than anything the
   capped one reached. Indexing it is fine; letting it drag the checkpoint over the
   threads we never saw is not.
