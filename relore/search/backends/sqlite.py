"""The SQLite backend: FTS5, ranked by ``bm25``. A development affordance, not a
deployment (section 4.1).

Two things about it are load-bearing, and both are traps rather than preferences.

**The score is negated.** FTS5's ``bm25()`` returns a value where *more negative* is more
relevant. :meth:`SqliteBackend.fts_score` flips it so "higher is better" holds on both
backends and the caps in ``queries.py`` need no dialect knowledge.

**It cannot rank text it did not MATCH.** ``bm25()`` is an auxiliary function of the FTS5
index, so it is an error anywhere but a query that joined and matched it -- which means
:meth:`SqliteBackend.unfiltered_fts_score` has to return ``None`` and section 6's lexical
term is simply absent from a textless expansion leg here. The signal overlaps and the decay
still score, so those legs are ordered rather than tied; they are ordered by less. Section
4.1 already refuses to compare a number across backends, and this is one of the reasons.

**User text never reaches ``MATCH`` as written.** ``MATCH`` takes a query *language* --
``"``, ``*``, ``:``, ``^``, ``-``, ``(`` and the bare words ``AND``/``OR``/``NOT`` all
mean something in it, and an unbalanced quote is a hard error rather than an empty result.
A pasted traceback contains most of those characters. So the text is tokenized and
re-emitted as quoted terms, which is also what makes this an AND of the terms and
therefore the same question ``plainto_tsquery`` answers on the other side.
