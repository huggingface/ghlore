# Run one long `relored` pass over a repository, as a Kubernetes Job.
#
# **Not `kubectl exec`.** Build plan section 3 sizes a backfill of a large repository
# at about a restartable *day*: ~3,600 REST requests and a GraphQL pass that is
# point-limited rather than request-limited, so 6-12 hours. A full `derive` is
# cheaper -- local CPU and one transaction per thread, no network -- but 48,000
# threads is still tens of minutes. An exec dies with the terminal that started it;
# a Job survives, restarts where it stopped, and can be watched from anywhere.
#
# Resuming is safe by construction. Every pass keeps its own cursor (section 5.2
# rule 4), the checkpoint advances per *committed* thread and stops at the first
# failure (rule 5), and `index_thread` makes re-processing a no-op (section 5.1) --
# so a killed Job re-covers the remainder rather than starting over or skipping.
# `derive` is re-runnable for the same reason and writes nothing for a thread that
# has not changed.

Usage: deploy/scripts/pass.sh VERB --repo OWNER/NAME [options]

VERB is one of backfill | derive | fetch | authority | sweep -- the passes long
enough to outlive a terminal. A full `derive` is what a change to extraction, the
trust derivation or the relationship edges needs before it reaches the index.

Options:
      --repo OWNER/NAME   required; must be in the chart's allowlist
  -n, --namespace NAME    default: ghlore
  -r, --release NAME      default: ghlore
      --context NAME      kubectl context
  -f, --follow            stream the logs after creating the Job
      --                  everything after this is passed to `relored VERB`
  -h, --help              this

Examples:
  deploy/scripts/pass.sh backfill --repo huggingface/transformers --follow
  deploy/scripts/pass.sh derive   --repo huggingface/transformers --follow
  deploy/scripts/pass.sh backfill --repo huggingface/x -- --no-graphql
