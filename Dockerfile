# relore — the daemon image. `relored` and `relore`, nothing else.
#
# It installs `relore[postgres,python]`: the daemon's half of the code lens landed, so
# without a parser `symbol`, `copies` and `defs`/`refs --repo` answer `MissingParser`.
# `git` is what `relored clone` and `why`'s blame shell out to.
#
# `pg_isready` comes from postgresql-client and is used by the migrate hook to
# wait for the database rather than fail the release on a first-install race.
